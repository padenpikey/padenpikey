I recently enrolled in TripleTen's Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to develop real world techincal data skills I can use in future roles. Six techincal projects later, I'm now well versed in advanced spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, Power BI and other technical skills. I enjoy using pivot tables to target data and Tableau to visualize what the data is saying. 

I graduated from Indiana University and spent the next three years in both outside and inside sales roles. I learned invaluable soft skills such as building trust and rapport, active listening, empathizing, negotiating, and closing. Promotions within these sales roles had me desiring to understand business as a whole. I tranisitioned to working contract roles for corporate Walmart to get a foot in the door to business sectors that peaked my interest in regard to serving the customer, my coworkers, and my future life/career aspirations.


Fun Facts About Me:

- I enjoy building upon hobbies like music, exercise, and recreational sports because I believe there is more to life than occupational centered work. 
- My dream job would be touring the U.S. as a music artist to connect with other souls through melodies and relatable life themes. 
- I'm extroverted. My favorite place to be isn't a location, but where I have a great community to be apart of.
